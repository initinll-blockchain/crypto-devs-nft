## Running back-end Solidity smart contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

## Add Hardhat Local Account to MetaMask
Add hardhat local account - 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 to metamask wallet

switch contract address from rinkeby testnet to localhost at - CryptoDevsService.ts

```
// from
export function getContractAddress() {    
    return Constants.CONTRACT_ADDRESS_RINKEBY;
}

// to
export function getContractAddress() {    
    return Constants.CONTRACT_ADDRESS_LOCALHOST;
}
```

## Running front-end Svelte app

Once you've switched to project directory and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
